# Hello! :)

I'm a Sociology PhD student at Duke and an early-career Computational Social Scientist. I did my undergrad in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I want to investigate the societal impacts of social technologies such as artificial intelligence and social media, and build technologies that facilitate healthy individual experiences and a world that is less divided.

I am advised by <a href="https://www.chrisbail.net/">Chris Bail</a> and study with Duke's <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab</a>. I am a Graduate Fellow of Duke's new <a href="https://scai.duke.edu/">Society-Centered AI Initiative</a>, and the lead program assistant for the <a href="https://sicss.io/">Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science</a> and Tech for Open Minds.

Formerly, I worked with the <a href="https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu">Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab</a> under <a href="http://www.munmund.net">Professor Munmun De Choudhury</a> to explore disparities in mental health narratives using search engine data.


### Background
I've been a Software Engineering Intern at Pegasystems and Shentel in the past. My wife and I enjoy hiking and exploring new places around Durham together. I play flute, piano, percussion, and produce electronic music. I am an Eagle Scout.
