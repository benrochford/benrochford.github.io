# Hello! :)

I'm an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech and an aspiring Computational Social Scientist. I want to investigate the cultural impacts of online social systems, and discover ways to build technologies that facilitate healthy individual experiences and a healthy world.

I'm exploring disparities in mental health narratives using search engine data as an undergraduate researcher at the Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab under Professor Munmun De Choudhury.

### Background
I've been a software engineering intern at Pegasystems and Shentel in the past. When I'm not in Atlanta, I call historic Williamsburg Virgnia my home. I play the flute and I am an Eagle Scout.
