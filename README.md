# Hello! :)

I'm a first-year Sociology PhD student at Duke and an aspiring Computational Social Scientist. I did my undergrad in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I want to investigate the cultural impacts of online social systems, and find ways to build technologies that facilitate healthy individual experiences and a world that is less divided.

I am advised by <a href="https://www.chrisbail.net/">Chris Bail</a> and study with Duke's <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab</a>.

Formerly, I worked with the <a href="https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu">Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab</a> under <a href="http://www.munmund.net">Professor Munmun De Choudhury</a> to explore disparities in mental health narratives using search engine data.


### Background
I've been a Software Engineering Intern at Pegasystems and Shentel in the past. When I'm not in Durham, I call historic Williamsburg Virginia my home. I play flute, piano, percussion, and produce electronic music. I am an Eagle Scout.
